* No ChangeLog files

  Do not write ChangeLog files for Pinentry.  We put change
  information only in the GIT commit log, and generate a top-level
  ChangeLog file from logs at "make dist" time.  As such, there are
  strict requirements on the form of the commit log messages.


* Commit log requirements

  Your commit log should always start with a one-line summary, the
  second line should be blank, and the remaining lines are usually
  ChangeLog-style entries for all affected files.  However, it's fine
  -- even recommended -- to write a few lines of prose describing the
  change, when the summary and ChangeLog entries don't give enough of
  the big picture.  Omit the leading TABs that you're used to seeing
  in a "real" ChangeLog file, but keep the maximum line length at 72
  or smaller, so that the generated ChangeLog lines, each with its
  leading TAB, will not exceed 80 columns.

  For more infomration please check the HACHING file from the GnuPG
  project.

* String translation

  Pinentry does not not require any translation files because it
  expects that all strings are provided localized by the caller.  This
  is due to the design constraint to keep the tool simple and also to
  make sure that translations match those of GnuPG.

  The available translated strings can be found in GnuPG, file
  agent/call-pinentry, function start_pinentry.  If a string is not
  available the Pinentry code uses a default as a fallback.  However,
  it is highly suggested to provide Pinentry with translated strings.
